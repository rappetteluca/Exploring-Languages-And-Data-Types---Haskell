## Description:

- "Lists.hs" describes a few list functions I made when I was just learning Haskell. The Data.List module is a seriously stellar way to pick up
this (almost) pure functional programming lanaguage quickly. The three functions and their equivalent algorithims are written below.
 - seal == Quicksort
 - isSubList == isInfixOf Function
 - combinator == Cartesian Cross Product
- "Predicate Sets.hs" describes an infinite set structure. By limiting set storage as an ever evolving higher order function through composition
you can yield powerful storage results without having a lot of memory overhead. In short: An expression is a lot easier to store than tons of data points.
 - Predicate Sets has the usual Set featured methods.

## How to build the software

Haskell Compiles at run-time.


## How to use the software

Run with GHCi.


## How the software was tested

Testing was completed by using outlier-like input arguments in order to stress
test high order function behavior in predicate sets.


## Known bugs and problem areas

None.

"Lists.hs" describes a few list functions I made when I was just learning Haskell. The Data.List module is a seriously stellar way to pick up
this (almost) pure functional programming lanaguage quickly. The three functions and their equivalent algorithims are written below.

seal == Quicksort

'isSubList' == 'isInfixOf'

combinator == Cartesian Cross Product


"Predicate Sets.hs" describes an infinite set structure. By limiting set storage as an ever evolving higher order function through composition
you can yield powerful storage results without having a lot of memory overhead. In short: An expression is a lot easier to store than tons of data points.

Predicate Sets has the usual Set featured methods.
